Correlation Matrix Analysis:
“To assess relationships between variables despite missing data, 
I compared correlation matrices using two methods: the standard complete case approach (cor(diabetes[,1:8])) and the pairwise method (cor(diabetes[,1:8], use="pairwise.complete.obs")). 
The differences between these matrices, especially for 'Skin.Thick' and 'Insulin,' showed me how missing data handling can influence correlation strength. 
The pairwise method generally led to lower correlations due to the reduced sample size for each pair,
highlighting how missingness can impact data interpretations and possibly affect insights on variable associations.”
