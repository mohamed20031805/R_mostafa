MCA of Missing Data Patterns:
“I explored the missing data patterns further with Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), revealing that specific variables tend to be missing together, notably 'Skin.Thick' and 'Insulin.' The MCA factor map allowed me to see how the absence of these variables often coincides, suggesting a dependency or a common reason behind their missingness. Recognizing these patterns is useful, as it hints that a multivariate imputation approach may be more appropriate for this dataset, helping to maintain the original relationships between variables even when values are missing.”
